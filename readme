1. Made the skeletons
2. Made an array called myLibrary which will store book objects (made a function for book object constructor with (title, author, pages, read))
Add separate addBookToLibarary function that takes arguments(objTitle, objAuthor, objPages, objRead) 
Used crypto.randomUUID to make and save unique id for book object

3. Used 'for loop' to loops through the array and displays each book on the page with forEach()

4. Make a dialog that show and close with buttons, and link with other functions, show & close dialog with event

5. add remove to the card or the display so that when user wants to remove it they can remove from the library
5-1 mistakes 
1) I used id a lot to the card. so i changed to class
2) my remove logic wasn't dynamic so i have to put this logic inside the makeCard() so the remove button will activate even when user put new card on the display
3) container.removeChild(card) always removes the same card
â†’ Because const card = document.querySelector("#card") always targets the first card, not the one associated with the button clicked.
